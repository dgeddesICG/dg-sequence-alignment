This submodule is an amalgamation of functions from the cjn-sequence-alignment and j_postacquisition submodules to maintain consisitent synchronisation over long courses for imaging multiple fish / multiple sync profiles.
As part of the update for mutlifish imaging the python backend now tracks the history relating parameters in that not only NEW information is passed in from the Objective C class PythonService and we return only the required parameters back to PythonService.
The 3 main functions processNewReferenceSequence, trimLTUHistory, RoIForReferenceHistory are wrappers for functions in the memoryCC module. processNewReferenceSequence and trimLTUHistroy both follow the same structure: history parameters for the fishIndex we pass in are retreived from the oracle; then these parameters are passed into the corresponding function in memoryCC; outputs of the memoryCC function call are used to update the history parameters in the oracle; and finally neccessary parameters are return back to the Objective C side. 
There are additional helper functions that are callable from PythonService deal with reseting history parameters (resetRefFrameHistory, resetMultifishOracle, clearMultifishOracle) and numRefFrameSetsInHistory which queries an entry of the oracle.
